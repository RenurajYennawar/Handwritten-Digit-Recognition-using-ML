# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-ML
This Repository consists of Hnadwritten digit recognition MNIST Data using Machine learning algorithms
This dataset consists of handwritten digit recognition taken from kaggle. it consists the digits 0-9 written in various forms, we will now recognize these digits using ML algorithms.this is a classification problem in which the digits in different forms are features and the final digit from 0-9 are labels. the dataset was taken from kaggle and it was divided into various parts as listed below:
train.csv file contains images (28 x 28) representaed as rows (784 dimensional) and a label as digit
train.csv file contains images (28 x 28) representaed as rows (784 dimensional)
sample_submission.csv is the file which contains test image number and corresponding predicted digit Soultion is submitted in sample_submission.csv file
